Internet of Things Malware Ontology in Protege 4
Internet of Things (IoT) devices  have increased in number and diversity of  application domains in the recent past.   The  registered Malicious software (malware) attacks currently  in the IoT environment demonstrates that hierarchical categorization of malware characteristics is obsolete and not sufficient to define the complexity of IoT domain  malware. We  formulate an ontology for Internet of things malware using Protege 4 . The formulated ontology caters for heterogeneity of attacks , harmonized meta-data definitions, reduced mis-attribution and will aid to improve malware analysis tasks.
